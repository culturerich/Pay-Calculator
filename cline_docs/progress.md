# Project Progress

## Current Status
🟢 Core Implementation Phase - Layout and UI Enhancements

## Recent Changes
- Enhanced the TotalCalculations component:
  - Incorporated individual worker calculation tables into the grand totals table with collapsible sections
  - Replaced the "no calculations to display yet" message with a normal table showing 0 figures
  - Made worker calculation details expandable/collapsible
- Restructured the application layout:
  - Created a two-column layout for desktop with main content on the left and totals on the right
  - Made the totals section sticky for desktop so it remains visible while scrolling
  - Ensured the Notes section appears last on both desktop and mobile layouts
- Made the worker-uplifts-trigger closed by default for better UI organization
- Changed the default value for daysPerWeek from 5 to 0 in both PayCalculatorContext.jsx and WorkerManager.jsx
- Added visual cues for selected uplifts in WorkerRow component:
  - Left border indicator for selected uplifts
  - Bold text and accent color for selected uplift titles
- Improved indentation display in WorkerRow uplift section
- Completed all core component implementations
- Verified Notes component is fully implemented and working
- Confirmed collapsible sections are properly styled and functional
