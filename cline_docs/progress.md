## Next Steps
1. Extract calculation logic to a dedicated service
2. Implement data persistence with LocalStorage
3. Add export functionality
4. Improve form validation and error handling
5. Add accessibility enhancements

## Known Issues
- Calculation logic is embedded in the TotalCalculations component instead of a dedicated service
- No data persistence implemented yet
- Missing export functionality
- Limited form validation
- No error handling for edge cases

## Future Enhancements
- Style system integration
- Additional export formats
- API integration for live rates
- Tax and take-home pay calculations
- Visualization of pay breakdown
- Multiple currency support
