# Active Context

## Current Focus

Implementing improvements and fixes to the Pay Calculator application:

1. Reviewing the current implementation
2. Identifying areas for improvement
3. Planning implementation of missing features

## Recent Changes

- Completed TotalCalculations implementation:
  - Added calculation logic for worker salaries with uplifts
  - Implemented employer NI contribution calculations
  - Added pension contribution calculations
  - Created responsive UI for displaying calculations
  - Added grand totals section
  - Implemented empty state handling
- Completed WorkerManager and WorkerRow components:
  - Implemented worker state management
  - Added NI category selection with Radix Select
  - Created uplift checkbox integration
  - Added worker deletion with confirmation dialog
  - Styled components for consistency
- Improved styling across all components:
  - Moved section headers outside boxes for better hierarchy
  - Made uplift rows full-width for better space utilization
  - Fixed worker row uplift checkboxes alignment
  - Added consistent drag handle dots across uplifts and workers
  - Added plus icon to Add Worker button to match Add Uplift
  - Added two default workers in the context

## Current Task

Identifying improvements and fixes:

- Review calculation logic for accuracy
- Identify missing features from the product requirements
- Find opportunities for code refactoring and optimization
- Plan implementation of data persistence
- Evaluate accessibility improvements

## Next Steps

1. Implement PayCalculator service to separate calculation logic from UI components
2. Add StorageService for data persistence with LocalStorage
3. Implement ExportService for CSV and Google Sheets export
4. Add form validation and error handling
5. Implement accessibility improvements
6. Add unit tests for critical functionality

## Implementation Notes

- Calculation logic should be moved from TotalCalculations to a dedicated service
- LocalStorage integration needed for data persistence
- Need to implement proper form validation across all inputs
- Should add error handling for edge cases
- Need to implement export functionality

## Questions to Address

- How to structure the PayCalculator service
- Best approach for implementing the export functionality
- How to handle currency formatting consistently

## Current Blockers

None - ready to proceed with improvements
