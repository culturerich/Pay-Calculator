## Current Focus
Project setup phase completed. We are currently:
1. Moving into core component development
2. Planning component implementation order
3. Preparing to set up data structures

## Recent Changes
- Initialized React project using Vite
- Installed base dependencies

## Next Steps
1. Install Radix UI dependencies
2. Create data files (tax-years.json, ni-categories.json)
3. Set up basic App component structure
4. Begin implementing BasicDetails section

## Implementation Notes

- Project will use React with Radix UI
- Focus on accessibility from the start
- Need to implement proper error handling
- Performance optimization is a key consideration

## Questions to Address
