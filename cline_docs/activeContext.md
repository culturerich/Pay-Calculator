## Current Task

Completing remaining enhancements:

- ✅ Extract calculation logic from components to a dedicated PayCalculator service
- Implement form validation for the new input fields
- Add error handling for edge cases

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Extract calculation logic from components to a dedicated PayCalculator service
2. Implement form validation for the new input fields
3. Add error handling for edge cases
4. Test all new functionality thoroughly
5. After completing these enhancements:
   - Add StorageService for data persistence with LocalStorage
   - Implement ExportService for CSV and Google Sheets export
   - Add unit tests for critical functionality

## Implementation Notes

- The PayCalculator service should:
  - Centralize all calculation logic currently in components
  - Handle worker calculations with uplifts, NI, and pension
  - Support days-per-week pro-rata calculations
  - Provide consistent currency formatting
- Form validation should be added for:
  - Numeric inputs (salary, percentages, multipliers)
  - Required fields
- Error handling should address:
  - Invalid input values
  - Edge cases in calculations
  - Graceful fallbacks for unexpected scenarios

## Questions to Address

- How to structure the PayCalculator service
- Best approach for implementing the export functionality
- How to handle currency formatting consistently

## Current Blockers

None - ready to proceed with improvements
